              What do Pandas working in the mill have to do with anything? 
              You're right! Basically nothing, and this text is about JavaScript.
              JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting
              language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host
              environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be
              connected to the objects of its environment to provide
              programmatic control over them.
          </p>
            <p>
              JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
            </p>
            <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
              </li>
              <p>
              <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
            </p></ul>
          </ul>
          </p>

        </ul>

            </li><p>
            <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li></p>
            <p><li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</li>

        <ul>
        <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
        <p>With the keyword var. For example,</p>
        <code><span>var x = 42.</span></code>
        <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</p>
        <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
        <code><span>x = 42.</span></code>
        <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.</p>
        <p>With the keyword let. For example,</p>
        <code><span>let y = 13.</span></code>
        <p>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.
        </ul>
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
        <header class="headerBold">Variable scope
        </header>
        <ul>
        <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.</p>
        <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.</p>
        <code><span>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</span></code>
        <p>This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.</p>
        <code><span>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is
          not defined</span></code>
        <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.</p>
        <p>With the keyword let. For example,</p>
        <code><span>let y = 13.</span></code>
        <p>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable.

        <ul>
        <p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.</p>
<p>Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.</p>
