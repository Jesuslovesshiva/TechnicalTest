          A little happy sunlight shining through there. You have to make these
          big decisions. Just make little strokes like that. Let's make a nice
          big leafy tree. Let's have a little bit of fun today. The man who does
          the best job is the one who is happy at his job. Let the paint work.
          Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty
          of time.
        </p>

        <p>
          Tree trunks grow however makes them happy. Everyone needs a friend.
          Friends are the most valuable things in the world. You can do it.
          Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight.
          Not every limb is perfect. We artists are a different breed of people.
          We're a happy bunch. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives
          right there. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. It's a very
          cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. It’s about to freeze me to
          death. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.'
          And you may be right. Every time you practice, you learn more. This is
          a fantastic little painting.
        </p>

        <p>
          See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. A fan
          brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it.
          Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? Just think about
          these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. Let's have a happy
          little tree in here. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives
          right in here. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow. Let's
          get wild today.
        </p>

        <p>
          See there, told you that would be easy. You can do anything here. So
          don't worry about it. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it
          takes. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. Trees
          grow however makes them happy. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him
          to Washington.
        </p>

          We don't have anything but happy trees here. We want to use a lot
          pressure while using no pressure at all. A tree cannot be straight if
          it has a crooked trunk. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions.
          Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. With something so
          strong, a little bit can go a long way. I'm a water fanatic. I love
          water. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. Just use
          the old one inch brush.

          I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of
          us. The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job.
          That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want -
          and I can make this world as happy as I want it. Let your imagination
          be your guide. We'll do another happy little painting. This is
          probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm going to mix up a little color. We’ll use Van Dyke Brown,
          Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. Work on one thing at
          a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time.
        </p>
        <p id="lastP">
          Anything you want to do you can do here. A happy cloud. We spend so
          much of our life looking - but never seeing.
